<h4>From  0.8.3 to 0.8.4</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Made most fields in settings optional.</li>
</ul>

<h4>From  0.8.2 to 0.8.3</h4>

	<li>Modified the layout and behaviour of the settings menu</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug that caused overpaid invoices not to register as closed, in fact - rebuilt most of the &quot;status&quot; code to elimiate bugs </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>In order to accomodate itemized invoices, amount, work_description, and some tax information was migrated to a new table &quot;invoice_items&quot;.</li>
    <li>Previously, due to an oversight, an invoice was considered &quot;closed&quot; if the amount paid was &gt;= the amount owing <em>not considering</em> tax. This has been changed. For example, a $100 invoice with $7 tax will not be considered &quot;closed&quot; until $107 (or more) is entered in the payment. Previously, $100 would have marked it closed. </li>
    <li>Some lines lack appropriate translation, or are machine translated. I'd be grateful for any improvements non-English speakers could suggst.  </li>
